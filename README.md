# Easy breezy duplicate checker for columns in Google Sheets!
## (not super optimized but so convenient to check for mistakes for a smallllll project releasing soon)

## assumptions

You have a column that you can paste into notepad (or something similar) to make a .txt based array.

Right now, we are just looking for duplicate numbers, not words etc. You will need to delete words or else things crash (working on it)

## instructions

Replace array.txt with the column you would like to check! Then in main.py, choose whether you want to check for direct duplicate values or if you would like to check for duplicates that are side by side!
